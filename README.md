 Portfolio-simple-website

This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and CSS.
The website contains two pages:

Home Page: A clean introduction about me, including my name, a short description, and visuals to represent my portfolio.

Contact Page: A simple contact form where users can reach me by entering their name, email, and message.

The goal of this project is to create a basic online presence and practice building clean, structured web pages using only HTML and CSS.
